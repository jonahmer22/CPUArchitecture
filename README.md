# CPU Designs and Architecture Implementations

This repository contains CPU designs based on various architectures that I have created. It showcases different processor architectures and includes example code to help you test and understand how the designs work.

## Overview

This repository is a collection of various CPU designs and implementations, each based on a different architecture. These designs are created with an emphasis on modularity and simplicity, which allows you to study the inner workings of different CPU architectures and modify them to suit your needs. The repository also includes example code that you can run to test and interact with the CPU designs.

## Designs

### Overture Architectures
This section contains implementations of Overture architectures, focusing on simplicity and clear operations.

- **Example 1:** A simple 8-bit Overture processor with basic ALU operations.

### Other Architectures
This section may contain designs based on alternative or hybrid CPU architectures (e.g., VLIW, EPIC, etc.).

- **Example 1:** *(soon to come)*

## Example Code

In the `examples/` directory, you will find example code written in assembly or machine code to demonstrate the capabilities of each CPU design. The example code includes basic assembly code (probably a math operation) that can be run on the respective CPU.

To run these examples, simply load the corresponding assembly code into the CPU simulator or hardware design youâ€™re working with.
